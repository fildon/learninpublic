Who is adidas.com for?

Accessibility is Empathy

Permanent/Temporary/Situational

- You can't hear easily in a noisy crowd
- You can't look at your phone while driving
- It can be harder to make out contrast in bright sun glare
- New parents spend much of their day doing tasks one-handed

> In the United States, 26,000 people a
> year suffer from loss of upper extremities.
> But when we include people with temporary
> and situational impairments, the number is
> greater than 20M.

"Ephemeral disability"

"Measurable !== matters"

The user doesn't care about your website

Your user has limited resources

Prioritization

- Accessible
- Usable
- "frippery"

It's better to give many people a decent experience, than a few people a "delightful" experience

Your priorities betray your privileges and prejudices

Alienate fewer people

"HTML is the interface"

The backlog is never empty. But what is your priority?

Power is imbalanced. Use what power you have to help those who do not have power.

"Disability happens at the points of interaction between a person and society. Physical, cognitive, and social exclusion is the result of mismatched interactions." - from the Microsoft Inclusion 101 pamphlet

Technology in the abscence of a human is meaningless. Consider the socio-technical context of what you create.

Accessibility is not a problem to be solved

"Design for the extremes, then it'll work even better for everyone between those extremes"
