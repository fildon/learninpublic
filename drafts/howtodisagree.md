# How to disagree

Interesting problems are ones in which there is no absolute truth.

What is the answer to `1+1=?`. There is only one answer. Which is the best programming language? It would be silly to treat this like a mathematical puzzle with only a single outcome.

There is no single truth.

_If_ you believe there is a single truth, then any disagreement between you an a colleage means one or both of you are _WRONG_.

If instead we accept the relativity of correctness then we begin to look forward to people disagreeing with is, so that we can expand our minds.

## Different kinds of problem

Some problems have a single correct solution.

> What is 1+1? There is only one answer.

Others have many solutions.

> How can I cook a carrot?

While others have only fuzzy solutions.

> Which colour looks best on me?
