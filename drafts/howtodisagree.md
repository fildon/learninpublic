# How to disagree

Interesting problems are ones in which there is no absolute truth.

What is the answer to `1+1=?`. There is only one answer. Which is the best programming language? It would be silly to treat this like a mathematical puzzle with only a single outcome.

There is no single truth.

_If_ you believe there is a single truth, then any disagreement between you an a colleage means one or both of you are _WRONG_.

If instead we accept the relativity of correctness then we begin to look forward to people disagreeing with is, so that we can expand our minds.

## Different kinds of problem

Some problems have a single correct solution:

> What is 1+2?

Others have many solutions:

> How can I cook a carrot?

While others have only fuzzy solutions.

> Who was the greatest musician of all time?

Disagreements become unproductive when we mistake a fuzzy problem for a single-truth problem.

## Computer Science

Decision problems are equivalent to set membership.
But not every disagreement is a decision problem (in the formal sense).

## Process

- Expand the range of options
  - Propose options
  - Brainstorm
  - No stupid ideas!
- Evaluate the proposed options
  - Critically evaluate expected tradeoffs for each decision
  - Be honest about what you don't know
  - Stay rooted within your particular context
  - Identify your priorities
- Pick an option and document
  - Document it, for the benefit of others in similar disagreements in future
