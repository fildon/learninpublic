# FizzBuzz

Write a function which:

- Takes a number
- Returns a string

If the number is a multiple of 3 it should return "Fizz".
If the number is a multiple of 5 it should return "Buzz".
If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5 it should return "FizzBuzz".
Otherwise it should return the number coerced to a string.

Bonus challenges:

- If the number is a multiple of 7 the output should be reversed
- Do not use any `if` statements
- Print the output for all numbers between 1 and 100
  - Bonus bonus: do it without a loop
