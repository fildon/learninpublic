# Code Review

- Why review code
- How to review code

Unfortunately there are many competing and perverse incentives

PR authors:

- I just want to merge my code sooner
- I want my code to look the way I like it
- I'm bored of this task and just want to move onto the next thing

PR reviewers:

- I've been in the author's position. I want to approve quickly to make them happy.
- I don't want to pretend I know better than someone else. They probably thought about it anyway.
- Thinking is hard. If I'm not sure about this code... it's probably fine.

Communication between authors-reviewers that doesn't help:

- "Hey everyone can I just get some approvals?"
