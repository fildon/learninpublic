# CSS

## Where did it go wrong?

CSS.

CSS is a declarative language.

What is declarative programming?

"Most" programmers don't grok declarative programming.

"I don't get CSS".

Envy -> Contempt sublimation.

"CSS is bad".

"CSS is not a programming language".

Assertion of implied hierarchy. Dismissal of nuance.

"Tailwind is better than vanilla CSS"

"Procedural is better than declarative (because I can grok it)".

Tailwind is better than procedural CSS.

Producedural CSS was a mistake however.

Only utility classes lobotomizes CSS to only procedural programming.
