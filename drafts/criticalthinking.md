# Critical Thinking

## TO BE ADDED

- When to hard disagree with someone?
- When to listen?
- How to identify your own level?
  - Are you sure?
- Two people are arguing, how can you help them?
- How to help people up the ladder?
  - Trying to skip levels can be unproductive
    - e.g. Presenting a _nuanced pragmatic_ solution to a `confused fact-finder` just makes them a _biased jumper_.
      - e.g. "It depends" (pragmatic performer) is not a useful answer to a `confused fact-finder`.

## What is Critical Thinking?

I will be presenting a model of critical thinking.

## 1. Confused Fact-Finder

> Proceeds as if goal is to find the single "correct" answer

## 2. Biased Jumper

> Proceeds as if goal is to stack up evidence and information to support conclusion

## 3. Perpetual Analyzer

> Proceeds as if goal is to establish a detached, balanced view of evidence and information from different points of view

## 4. Pragmatic Performer

> Proceeds as if goal is to come to a well-founded conclusion based on objective comparisons of viable alternatives

## 5. Strategic Revisioner

> Proceeds as if goal is to construct knowledge, to move toward better conclusions or greater confidence in conclusions as the problem is addressed over time

## Conclusions

I must note that I have become something like a `Biased Jumper` for recommending the Wolcott model of critical thinking. When I first learnt about it, it "clicked" with me. And even as I have learned of other models of critical thinking, I find myself coming back to this one again and again.
