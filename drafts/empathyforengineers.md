## TODO chat log

I try to think of all disagreements in terms of the foundational, almost axiomatic differences between people
Almost no-one is completely irrational, disagreements typically take place a couple layers of abstraction too high
So I try to proactively find the lower level abstractions that people are failing to express

In some cases that seems to be the lower level belief "I can simplify my code by leveraging contextual knowledge from elsewhere"

> You are right, but there are implications to these differences :smile:

O totally, and I wouldn't advocate for avoiding that (edited)
But to get to a collaborative conclusion, we must first travel deep into people's mental models
Because either:
We change someone's foundational mental model (convince people that things change in the future, and we shouldn't rely on contextual knowledge)
Help someone to understand that axiomatic differences are at least partially arbitrary and therefore allow them to operate with a different set of axioms without impacting their ego (this though requires them to take differences in axioms non-personally in the first place... and that is the magic sauce :smile: )
In this case we seem to have got people to point 2 (operate against their own wishes) but I don't think they have succeeded in doing it from a place of empathy

Hence an action on me, to try to shift not his particular view on this topic but rather the very nature of how he handles disagreements

So that I can trust him in future to trust me/you even when his initial prespective is different

But to grow that trust in someone, we must also show willingness to sincerely acknowledge the validity of his perspectives (and then hope that he can reciprocate)

(Hence why I really try to show people that I understand their position, even while I don't accept it for myself)

I think all these things are aspects of the practice of empathy

And I really do want to emphasize, empathy is a practice

How do you practice empathy?

A huge question!

Sincerely my mind leaps in many different directions while trying to find an answer

Initial thoughts though:
Ego death
Plato's cave
Meditation

excellent points

These actually form a gradient from more academic to more practical:
Plato's cave is an academic point that just needs reading (TL;DR: all experience is subjective)
Meditation of all kinds is great, but on the particular topic of empathy: Metta is a style of meditation in which one actively practices focusing on the feeling of love for others. It is almost like a chant in your mind; as if you are repeatedly flexing the loving parts of your mind
Ego death... well that's a whole thing... but of relevance here, there are ways to induce this experience very viscerally. Ways that I shan't document on a company Slack server.

Some people will surprise you by changing their mind
11:42
(Sincerely and empathetically)
11:43
And some people will ... but only a long time after you tried to convince them... as if you implanted the idea in their mind, and it needed time to grow and fit with their other axioms
Which is a fun case because superficially it can look like someone has not understood your point of view... but they "get it" later
And it's why we mustn't become frustrated in the face of superficial disagreements... it's not that we "failed" to convince someone, it's just that the convincing might happen later in their mind in private :slightly_smiling_face:
