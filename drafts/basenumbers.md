# Base Numbers

TODO explain base number systems

Drawing different base number systems

## Decimal

Consider the number `two hundred and thirty four` which we might write as `234`.

It is equivalent to `2 hundreds` _and_ `3 tens` _and_ `4 ones`.

## Binary

Two hundred and thirty four is equivalent to 2 ^ 7 + TODO

## Natural Base

Common examples: 8 'octal', 16 'hexidecimal'

## Negative Base

Negabinary

Advantage of representing signed integers without a sign.

## Complex Base

Advantage of representing Gaussian integers without a sign or `i`.
