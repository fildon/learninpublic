4C2 gives 6

We can simulate a d6 by picking 2 items from 4 and using a look up table to produce a value.

Here is an example table, assuming we have four items called `A`, `B`, `C` and `D`:

|      |     |
| ---- | --- |
| `AB` | 1   |
| `AC` | 2   |
| `AD` | 3   |
| `BC` | 4   |
| `BD` | 5   |
| `CD` | 6   |
