# Why care about Accessibility

## Transcription from Video

This talk I had originally...

I'm going to start in a way that is very vulnerable for me. ...

I want you to think about, everyone that can hear my voice right now. What do you know about me?

My name is Rupert, but what else do you know about me?

If you are feeling very brave you might put a comment in the text chat.

Now whatever it is you are thinking, I'm going to tell you a secret.

I am dyslexic. I have a reading disorder. Dyslexic is a kind of reading disorder.

I am dyspraxic. I have a severly limited working memory. Doesn't affect my long term memory. My long term learning capabilities are unaffected. But I struggle mentally with handling a lot of short term memory.

I also have dysgraphia. It's a hand writing disorder.

I also have phonological disorder. I have difficulty ordering phonemes in speech and writing. Means I juggle up syllables sometimes. It's a bit like dyslexia, but dyslexia is normally how information goes in...

Now I'm not telling you this to pity me. I don't need it. I hope you'll agree for the most part, that I am able to work along side you just like anyone else. But I'm telling you this because I think it'll be a surprise to most of you. I sincerely hope that I've done enough of a good job to fit in here, without my difficulties causing any difficulties for anyone else.

So what's this got to do with accessibility? It's deeply personal to me, because although I am very fortunate in still broadly being able to access all the trappings of society just like anyone else. It makes me feel very passionate about the idea that maybe there are people in the world who are experiencing difficulties that aren't immediately obvious to you. I go to great lengths to make my difficulties not obvious to you. It follows therefore that I am very open minded to the idea that there are many people in the world with difficulties that aren't immediately conspicuous.

Now that's a lot about me. I want you to take a moment to think about yourself. Ask yourself "Am I normal?".

What difficulties have you had in your life? Either growing up, developing into an adult, or interacting with the world. I would guess everyone has had different struggles in their life. Different times in which they have not felt normal. And maybe even times when they have felt excluded from some experiences made availabel to others.

> Define normal

There is no such thing as normal. Everyone has different difficulties that they face.

Another point I would like to make on this. No matter how capable you might feel right now, in any capacity, your ability to walk on two legs, your ability to perceive the world with thwo eyes. Recognise that it is all temporary. We are all only temporarily abled.

Now. Let's think about adidas.com. Who is adidas.com for? Who was it designed for? Who does it serve? And who does it exclude?

A lot of people talk about accessibility as this thing that we should just do. But I want to rephrase that as "Accessibility is Empathy". Be empathetic, and having been empathetic, accessibility should feel so obviously necessary to you.

## Permanent Temporary Situational

A lot of people when they think about inclusion/exclusion/accessibility, they think in terms of permanent disabilities. They might think of a wheelchair user, or someone made permanently blind.

But when we think of the sorts of people that use our systems that experience some form of exclusion, we should also be aware of people that might only temporarily experience that exclusion.

You might find yourself in a noisy crowd, and you are trying to watch a video...

Or maybe you are driving in a car but can't look at the screen right now...

There is a way of categorizing different levels of ability in terms of a permanent affect, temporary affect and a situational affect.

Imagine someone who has lost the use of one of their arms. Maybe it's a neurological disorder, maybe nerve damage, maybe physic loss of arm. In the US alone 26000 people suffer from the loss of an upper extremity. "Upper extremity" includes finger/hand/lower/upper/arm/shoulder. 13 million suffer from a temporary form of the same disability. Suppose someone trips over and breaks their arm. It's going to heal, but their arm is now in a cast or a sling, it is not temporarily usable. The final category is situational. They give an example here of new parents. Many parents spend most of the day doing tasks one handed, not because their other hand doesn't work, but because it is cradling a baby.

So when we think about building interfaces, it's not only about permanent disability but also about temporary and situational disability.

## Disibility as a label

> I don't like to be labeled "disabled". I prefer "difference".

WHO definitions of disability.

1980:
In the context of health experience a disability is any restriction or lack of ability resulting ... within the range considered ... normal...

2019 (check!):
Disibility is not just a health problem it is a complex ... the interaction between features of a person's body and the features of a society within which he or she lives.

TL;DR: Disability is not a personal health condition, it is a mismatch of interactions and expectations.

## The curb cut effect

The curb cut effect.

There are little dips in the curb. Typically at pedestrian crossing. Those were originally designed solely for the benefit of wheelchair users. Before they existed wheelchair users would have to deal with the awkwardness of dropping off the curb at one side and mounting the curb at the other side. Wouldn't it be great if there was just a tiny little ramp down onto the road and then back up again at the other side.

But these days we don't really think of them as boing just for wheelchair users. If you were walking around with a shopping trolley you wouldn't hesitate to use it, and that's totally fine. If you were pushing a pram with your baby in it, fantastic! Bikes, if you are on a bike, curb cuts are great.

It's not that you needed them, but you nonetheless benefitted from a system that was originally designed for a relatively narrow usecase.

We could talk about what percentage of the population use a wheelchair, but I think it would be more interesting to talk about what percentage of the population benefitted from thinking about how some pepole are excluded from society and proactively thinking about including more people benefits more than we might initially expect.

Closed captions on a video. Was originally designed solely for people who are hard of hearing. But I know lots of people, myself included, who prefer watching videos with subtitles on anyway. I can be in a noisy environment, watching a TV show, I can still read it.

> I use it for language development

TODO find data on this

Research done to demonstrate that language learning development for young children is enhanced by the presence of subtitles. It's an extra channel of information which helps to complement their ability to comprehend both written and spoken language.

Anecdotally I've also seen this being useful for adults learning a new language. Pairing written and spoken language.

## What is important?

Priorities. TODO reference Heydon

Whatever team you are in right now, ... you've got a backlog full of tasks. And here's this annoying guy Rupert coming along saying, there's more you need to care about. "But I've already got so much to do!"

No matter how many things ... that backlog is never going to be empty. Adding more things to it... there's never going to be a standup in which you decide there is nothing to do.

What happens in practice is, for your bottomless backlog, you prioritize what is most important. So I propose accessibility needs to exist somewhere in your backlog. Whether that is higher or lower, is by definition, your team's assessment of the priority of accessibility. So try and think really critically, "What's more important than this?". What is more of a priority?

What sorts of things do we do?

We think a lot about

- OKRs
- KPIs
- Monetization
- Logging
- Resiliency

Is accessibility less important than all those things?

I can't tell you what is important... but I would sincerely ask all of you to think very critically about what is valuable, what is important, what is a priority.

My final note:

Recognise that power is imbalanced in the world. Some pepole have more than others. Not all of us here have huge amounts of power, but not all of us have no power. So, I compel you all, whatever power you have, please use it to help those who have less than you.

Take care,

Rupert
