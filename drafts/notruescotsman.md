# No True Scotsman

> Gender is a social construct

My father was born and raised in Scotland. He has lived most of his life there. Am I Scottish because my father is?

Gender is a social construct

Data points vs categories

Words imply categories... But everyone's internal categories are different. Even when formally defined nature will confound you with exceptions.

## Example: Rupert

What categories apply to me? Who might agree? Who might disagree?

Claim: I am Scottish.

- My father was born and raised in Scotland.
  - However I was not.
- I have a historically Scottish surname, originating from a major Scottish clan.
  - However there exist Scottish people who do not have such a historically Scottish surname.

Claim: I am male.

- I have male genitalia.
  - Would I cease to be male were I to lose my genitals?
- So far as I know, I am able to 'father' children.
  - Although this has _not yet_ been empirically tested.
- I am taller than an average human.
  - How much taller? Is it enough? How much would it matter to my gender were I shorter?

## Theory meets reality

It's all well and good discussing theory, and the inherent ambiguity of all words and language. But language has power. When we police the use of language, we enforce a particular view of the world on others. What should we _as a society_ enforce?

Some things are a matter of safety. I am a licensed driver in the Netherlands. _The legal instruments_ of the Netherlands has seen fit to bestow on me, membership in the category of "licensed drivers".

However the Netherlands is utterly disinterested in whether I am or am not "a hipster".

One might wonder then, what is the category of categories that we want to legally enforce? Assuming that such a category of categories is non-empty... is gender a member of that category?

Laws should not be enforced _for the sake of it_, but to some end, for a purpose. In the case of licensed drivers, the ramifications for the general safety of the roads is clear. _What is the purpose of enforcing binary gender?_
