# Intention vs Implementation

A function by definition _is its implementation_.

To say whether a function is _correct_ requires a statement about its _intention_.

How then do we convey _intention_.

## Intention

// TODO how to convey intention

## Implementation

// TODO

Libraries obfuscate implementation

- Is this a good thing? (Encapsulation of complexity)
- Or a bad thing? (lack of transparency, requirement of trust)
